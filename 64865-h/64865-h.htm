<h3>STATEMENT OF THE POLICY OF THE PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH TOURIST BUREAU IN OUR RELATIONS WITH THE AMISH</h3>
<p><i class="small">We recognize that the Amish way of life is based on the literal application
of the Word of the Bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ to their everyday
life, with the result that many of their customs and beliefs have a religious
significance not immediately apparent to those not of the Amish faith.</i></p>
<p><i class="small">It is our purpose to give to those beliefs and customs of the Amish, which
are matters of religion, the same respect and reverence which we give to
symbols of other religions.</i></p>
<p><i class="small">Exodus 20:4 states: &ldquo;Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing,
nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven above or in the earth beneath,
nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i class="small">The Amish believe that the taking of photographs violates this commandment
if the face of the individual photographed is recognizable as that individual.
We agree not to violate that rule without the permission of the
person photographed.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>

offers more to the tourist than perhaps any other area of our
country. Honeycombed with fine hard-topped roads, Lancaster
County is the happy hunting ground for the visitor, who wishes
to concern himself with the quaint and the historic. It is the
ideal spot for quiet leisurely travel through the most picturesque
and well-tended farm land to be found anywhere.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the Plain People of Lancaster County are of great
interest to the tourist considerable space in the Guide-Book has
been devoted to them. Certainly, these fine agrarians, with their
quaint customs and their somber dress, will command much of the
visitors&rsquo; attention but they are by no means the only reason for
spending much time in this section of Pennsylvania. You are urged
to make a careful study of this Guide-Book, so that you will be
fully aware of all that the Pennsylvania Dutch Country has to
offer.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Highlights of Lancaster&rsquo;s History</span></h2>
<p class="center">By DR. H. M. J. KLEIN</p>
<p><i class="small">Oftimes referred to as &ldquo;Mr. Lancaster,&rdquo; Dr. H. M. J. Klein has made a
contribution to virtually every facet of public life. Teacher, minister
of the Gospel, and counselor in affairs of City and State.</i></p>
<p>Lancaster County soil was fertile Indian territory long before
the discovery of America. Before the coming of William Penn,
French traders bartered with the native Shawanese. In the later days
when there was trouble between the French and the English in America,
the governor of the province, John Evans, visited these Indian settlements
in order to establish their loyalty to Queen Anne.</p>
<p>As early as 1709 a colony of Mennonites came from Switzerland
under the leadership of Hans Herr&mdash;whose house is still standing, the
oldest in the County&mdash;and began to make this district the richest
agricultural region in the United States. Then came the French Huguenots,
the Scotch-Irish, the Quakers, the Welsh, the Palatines.</p>
<p>At the time when Pennsylvania had only three counties, Philadelphia,
Bucks and Chester, from the last-named county a section was
separated, to which John Wright, a native of Lancaster, England, one
of the first settlers in this region, gave the name of Lancaster County.
This separation took place in 1729. Out of the original Lancaster
County, York, Cumberland, Berks, Northumberland, Dauphin and
Lebanon counties have since been taken, leaving Lancaster County
today an area of 928 square miles of territory which for beauty, fertility
and picturesqueness is unexcelled.</p>
<p>On a plot of ground owned by Andrew Hamilton, and divided by
him into town lots, there sprang up two hundred and thirty years ago
an embryo village called &ldquo;Hickory Town&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gibson&rsquo;s Pasture&rdquo; which
was the beginning of what is now known as Lancaster City. When
Andrew Hamilton laid out this village in 1730 on the 500-acre tract
of land he owned, there were less than two hundred inhabitants in the
town. It was through his son, James Hamilton, that the village was
turned into a borough in 1742. The first Burgess of Lancaster was
Thomas Cookson, an Englishman, whose remains are interred in the
church yard of St. James Episcopal Church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>A number of important Indian treaties were made at Lancaster
in 1744 between the chiefs of the Six Nations and the rulers of Pennsylvania,
Virginia and Maryland. In the formulation of these treaties,
all the disputes between the whites and the Indians came up for
discussion.</p>
<p>During the French and Indian War, through the influence of
Benjamin Franklin, hundreds of wagons and pack horses were sent
from Lancaster to General Braddock. Many officers and soldiers from
this section served in the battalions which marched with Forbes and
Bouquet to the Ohio. In this list of Lancaster County men who served
in the French and Indian Wars are found the names of Shippen, Grubb,
Atlee, Hambright, Reynolds and a roll of five Presbyterian clergymen
serving as chaplains.</p>
<p>The Indian history of Lancaster County ends in 1763, when a
band of sixty men called the Paxton boys came to this city, stormed
the jail and workhouse, then located at the northwest corner of West
King and Prince Streets, and massacred all the Indians confined there
for protection.</p>
<p>In the days of the American Revolution, Lancaster was an important
center of patriotic activities. After the closing of Boston Port, a meeting
of protest was held in the Lancaster Court House. Her deputies
attended the Pennsylvania Convention in Philadelphia and joined in
a call for a Colonial Congress. After Lexington, the citizens at a
public meeting pledged their lives and fortunes to the cause of all the
Colonies, and companies of expert riflemen were organized. William
Simpson of Captain Smith&rsquo;s Lancaster company, was the first Pennsylvania
soldier who fell in the Revolutionary War. Many British
prisoners were brought to Lancaster, among them being Major Andre,
kept for a time at the Cope House, corner of Grant and North Lime
Streets.</p>
<p>When the British were on the point of occupying Philadelphia,
Continental Congress and the Executive Council of Pennsylvania were
removed to Lancaster. The members of Continental Congress arrived
here on September 27, 1777, the very day on which General Howe
entered Philadelphia. The records and treasury were removed to Lancaster
by way of Reading. One session of Congress was held here; but
the members, believing that they might be interrupted by the enemy,
resolved to remove Congress to York.</p>
<p>The Executive Council of Pennsylvania met here on October 1,
1777 and its sessions continued to be held in this city for nearly nine
months, during which time the President of the Council, the Hon.
Thomas J. Wharton, Jr., died, and was interred in Trinity Evangelical
Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>Lancaster furnished a signer of the Declaration of Independence
in the person of George Ross. Another son of Lancaster, who brought
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
distinction to his native soil, was David Ramsay, the historian of the
Revolution. William Henry conducted a gun factory to manufacture
and repair arms for the Continental army. His son, John Joseph Henry,
took part in the expedition against Quebec and immortalized the campaign
by his accurate and interesting account of the hardships and
sufferings of that band of heroes who traversed the wilderness in an
attempt to take Canada for the Colonial cause.</p>

</div>
<p>The greatest military hero of Lancaster during the Revolution
was General Edward Hand, one of Washington&rsquo;s most trusted aides,
who fought in the battles of Trenton and Long Island, succeeded Stark
in command at Albany, and accompanied Sullivan&rsquo;s Expedition against
the Six Nations in 1779. His home &ldquo;Rock Ford&rdquo; still stands along the
Conestoga River in the southeastern part of the city. Under the roof
of this hospitable mansion, General Washington, Lady Washington
and many soldiers and civilians famous in the early annals of our
nation found shelter and congenial companionship.</p>
<p>In Revolutionary days the Moravian brethren at Lititz cared for
many wounded soldiers, Continental, British, and Hessian, in a building
that is still standing. Peter Miller among the Brothers and Sisters
in the Ephrata Cloister translated the Declaration of Independence into
many foreign tongues.</p>
<p>Lancaster is the home of Franklin and Marshall College. This
institution developed out of what was originally Franklin College,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
founded at the suggestion of Benjamin Franklin. The Legislature of
Pennsylvania granted the College its first charter in 1787. Among the
first trustees were four signers of the Declaration of Independence and
seven officers of the Revolutionary Army.</p>
<p>George Washington visited Lancaster on several occasions, the
most notable of which fell on the fifteenth anniversary of American
Independence, July 4, 1791.</p>
<p>Lancaster was the capital of Pennsylvania from 1799 to 1812,
when the state capital was removed to Harrisburg. The State Legislature
met in the Court House, which at that time was known as the
State House, and stood in the center of the square, where the Soldiers&rsquo;
and Sailors&rsquo; Monument now stands.</p>
<p>Old Lancaster, with its Conestoga wagons, its story-and-a-half
buildings, its colonial architecture, its historic associations, was the
largest inland town in the colonies up to the time of the formation of
the nation. It had 678 houses and 4,200 inhabitants in 1786. On its
streets Robert Fulton played as a boy. The original Fulton birthplace
is still standing in southern Lancaster County. The oldest continuous
business firm in the county was the Steinman Hardware Company established
in 1744 and closing in 1964. It was the oldest hardware store in
the United States. The Demuth Tobacco Shop on East King Street,
established in 1770, is the oldest tobacco shop in the United States. The
Hager store is the oldest department store in America continuing on the
same site and operated by the Hager family throughout the whole period
of its history. One of Lancaster&rsquo;s daily newspapers has been in existence
for over a hundred and sixty-nine years.</p>
<p>Old Lancaster became New Lancaster when, after a period of
seventy-six years under burgess rule, the town was incorporated as a
city by a charter granted in 1818. John Passmore became the first
Mayor of the city.</p>
<p>In the hundred and forty-eight years since its formation as a city,
Lancaster has been the scene of widespread activities. It has developed
into a progressive modern city under the leadership of men, many of
whom have exerted a nation-wide influence. Foremost among these
men was President James Buchanan, who first came into prominence
as a young Lancaster lawyer in 1814, through a speech he delivered at
a public meeting in this city after the city of Washington had been
captured by the British. He was among the first to register as a
volunteer with a company of dragoons, who marched from here for the
defense of Baltimore. He represented this community in Congress when
he was barely 29 years of age. From here he went to St. Petersburg
under an appointment of President Jackson as Minister to Russia.
Upon his return, he was chosen United States Senator and filled that
office for ten years, after which he became Secretary of State under
President Polk and later United States Minister to England under
President Pierce. At the time of his election as the 15th President of
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
the United States, he lived in the fine old colonial mansion known as
&ldquo;Wheatland&rdquo; built in the suburbs of Lancaster. Few persons visit
Lancaster for the first time without getting a glimpse of this historic
spot, which has lost none of its generous hospitality. In Woodward
Hill Cemetery, South Queen Street, five blocks from Penn Square, rests
the remains of James Buchanan. The recently restored gravesite includes
an exact replica of the marble tomb in granite. It is now a worthy shrine
for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s only native President. School children throughout the
State contributed to the restoration, which was sponsored by the Pilot Club.</p>

<p>Lancaster has many associations with the Civil War. The first
bloodshed in the United States caused by the Fugitive Slave Law,
occurred in Christiana, Lancaster County.</p>
<p>President Lincoln, on his way to the White House from Springfield,
stopped at Lancaster and delivered an address from the balcony of the
Caldwell House, now the site of the Hilton Inn. When he passed
through this city again on April 21, 1865, Lincoln&rsquo;s body rested in a
heavily-draped funeral car, and the sorrowing crowds stood with
uncovered heads while the train passed. But between these two events,
Lancaster showed its loyalty to Lincoln and his cause by a remarkable
response to the call of the Union for troops in the war of the Rebellion.
Soldiers from Lancaster County were found in sixty regiments of Pennsylvania.
The well-known seventy-ninth regiment commanded by
Colonel Hambright was composed wholly of volunteers. Shortly before
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
the battle of Gettysburg, when General Early reached York and the
brigade was sent to hold the bridge at Columbia, and the bridge was
set on fire in order to prevent it from falling into the hands of the
Southern Army, long lines of refugees passed through Lancaster. At
Gettysburg, Major General John Fulton Reynolds, worthy son of Lancaster,
commanding the Pennsylvania reserves, was among the first to
lay down his life on his country&rsquo;s altar. His body was carried to
Lancaster and lies buried in the family enclosure in the Lancaster
Cemetery. Every visitor to Gettysburg knows of the handsome statue
erected to the memory of General Reynolds on that immortal battlefield.</p>
<p>On the Soldiers&rsquo; and Sailors&rsquo; Monument, now standing in Center
Square, the names of the following battlefields are carved in high relief:
Gettysburg, Antietam, Malvern Hill, Vicksburg, Wilderness, Chaplin
Hills, Chickamauga, Petersburg. These names are a testimony to the
martial valor of Lancaster County in the Civil War.</p>
<p>Lancaster has furnished many notable men and women to our
national life. Thaddeus Stevens, the Great Commoner, lived in this
city during the greater portion of his life. He was elected by the Whig
Party to Congress in 1848, and threw himself into the arena as the
aggressive foe of slavery. Throughout the Civil War he was one of the
most strenuous advocates of emancipation and an able counsellor of
President Lincoln. After his death in 1868, a noted historian said,
&ldquo;In the Congress of the United States from the time of its first officer,
Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg, to this day, there was just one man
who when he occupied a seat in that body held more power than any
man in the government, and that man was a citizen of Lancaster
County, Thaddeus Stevens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the many other notable personages associated with Lancaster
were Benjamin West, the famous painter; Lindley Murray,
America&rsquo;s foremost grammarian; Lloyd Mifflin, one of the finest
sonneteers of modern times, and Barbara Frietchie, who was born here.</p>
<p>To education, Lancaster has given the services of three State Superintendents
of Public Instruction, James P. Wickersham, E. E. Higbee
and Nathan C. Schaeffer; also Thomas W. Burrowes, the father of the
free school system of Pennsylvania. In art, Lancaster has contributed
the portrait painter, Jacob Eichholtz, who painted more than two
hundred and fifty portraits, among his subjects being Chief Justice
Marshall and many others of the foremost people of his day. The
well-known Baron Stiegel was for many years a resident of Lancaster
County and established in the town of Manheim a glass factory, the
wares of which are highly cherished by antiquarians.</p>
<p>There is a remarkable mingling in Lancaster County of the old
and the new&mdash;an atmosphere of quaintness, friendliness and cordiality.
The county is full of the beauty and bounty of God, as the old of
yesterday and the new of tomorrow meet in the Lancaster area whose
influence reaches far and wide in the shaping of the larger life of the
nation.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Some Historic Churches in Lancaster County</span></h2>
<p class="center">By DR. H. M. J. KLEIN</p>
<p>In response to William Penn&rsquo;s invitation, a large number of European
people left their homes during the first quarter of the eighteenth
century and came to Pennsylvania in search of religious freedom and
economic opportunity.</p>
<p>Following the rivers and the Indian trails from Philadelphia they
soon found their way to the rich soil which is now Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>As early as 1709 a small group of Mennonites, followers of the
martyr Menno Simons&mdash;&ldquo;Switzers&rdquo; as they were called&mdash;arrived in Penn&rsquo;s
Province, found their way to the Pequea creek and took up 10,000 acres of
land. They were the direct descendants of the bitterly persecuted Anabaptists
of the 16th century. They brought with them their lay ministers
and their Bibles, and worshipped at first in their log houses. Later when
these pioneer farmers began to erect meeting houses, they divided the
building into two apartments by a swinging partition suspended from
the ceiling. One apartment was used for religious, and the other for
school purposes. Today, large Mennonite &lsquo;meeting houses&rsquo; as their
church buildings are called, are found everywhere in Lancaster County:
at Willow Street, Mellingers, Strasburg, Manheim, Warwick and Brecknock
as well as in a score of other congregational centers. Their ministers
are now educated in the Mennonite colleges and seminaries. Two customs,
however, have been strictly maintained: feet-washing in connection with
the communion service, and the prayer head-covering among the women
of the church.</p>
<p>The Amish are an offspring from the Mennonites on the practice of
shunning. They came to America later. The names of Amish families
are found among the early settlers of Lancaster County as early as 1725.
About 1740 an Amish congregation was established near the headwaters
of the Conestoga and Pequea creeks in Lancaster County. This settlement
has continued to be a prosperous Amish community, and today
this region constitutes one of the largest Amish settlements in America.</p>
<p>The early Amish settlers worshipped in private houses. They believed
that to erect houses of worship was a tendency toward worldliness.
They all continued this practice of worship until more recently.
Today there are &ldquo;House-Amish&rdquo; and &ldquo;Church-Amish.&rdquo; The branch
which is known among them as the &ldquo;Old Order&rdquo; still continues to
worship in private homesteads. The Church Amish acquired a &lsquo;church
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
house&rsquo; for use in public worship. Their plain meeting houses are to
be found in northeastern Lancaster County. Religion, whether in homestead
or church, has first place in Amish life.</p>
<p>The Church of the Brethren, sometimes called Dunkers, is another
group of the plain People of Europe who accepted William Penn&rsquo;s
invitation in 1719 and to find its way to the Conestoga Valley. They
follow closely the practice of the Apostolic Church. Since 1776 they
have had higher institutions of learning, among them Elizabethtown
College located within the boundary of Lancaster County. They have
established homes for the aged, the infirm and the orphans in our area,
and are well organized for missionary endeavor. Their substantial
church buildings are scattered throughout the county.</p>
<p>While the Plain People were among the earliest and most unique
settlers in Lancaster County, they were soon followed in large numbers
by the so-called church people of Europe: the Lutherans, the Reformed,
the Moravians, the members of the Church of England and the Church
of Scotland, whose descendants today constitute a large majority of
the inhabitants of this county.</p>
<p>The Lutherans who probably outnumber the members of any other
religious denomination in Lancaster County, were among the earliest
settlers having been associated with New Sweden as early as 1643. Many
of their churches were founded in the county in the second quarter of
the 18th century. The New Holland Trinity Church dates from 1730.
The old Warwick Church at Brickerville records baptisms from 1731.
St. Michael&rsquo;s in Strasburg has a similar entry on May 1, 1730. Then
there is the story of Old Trinity in Lancaster, with its beginning in
1729, the year in which Lancaster County was established. Its church
building and school house were commenced in 1734.</p>
<p>The German Reformed Church people, coming from the Palatinate,
were in the Conestoga Valley before 1725. For the next few years
religious meetings were conducted in private houses by Conrad Tempelmann.
On October 15, 1727 the first Reformed communion service
was held in what is now known as Heller&rsquo;s Church in Upper Leacock
Township. When Lancaster became a Townstead, there were Reformed
congregations at Lancaster, Cocalico and Zeltenreich.</p>
<p>Among the churches that branched from Heller&rsquo;s Church was the
First Reformed congregation in Lancaster. Its log church was built
and dedicated in 1734 on a plot of ground given by James Hamilton.</p>
<p>Among the 18th century Reformed congregations in Lancaster
County are Maytown, Muddy Creek, Bethany near Ephrata, Zion&rsquo;s
at Brickerville; Christ Church, Elizabethtown; St. Stephens, New Holland;
Zeltenreich, near New Holland; Zion, New Providence; Swamp,
West Cocalico; St. Paul&rsquo;s, Manheim.</p>
<p>Lancaster County is one of the centres of the Moravian Church
in America. The Lititz congregation was organized soon after 1742,
following the visit of Count Zinzendorf. The original Gemeinhaus was
dedicated a few years later. Trombones were substituted for French
horns in the church orchestra in 1770.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="586" height="1000" />
<p class="pcap">TRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH</p>
</div>
<p>The Moravian Church in Lancaster
has an interesting history.
Count Zinzendorf preached in the
Court House in Center Square, Lancaster,
in 1742, when he was asked by
some of his hearers to send a regular
preacher to serve them. When Bishop
Spangenberg preached in the Court
House and advocated a merger of the
church denominations, he was pelted
with stones. The result was that the
Moravians of Lancaster erected a
stone church of their own on the
corner of Orange and Market streets.
It is recorded that the brethren
gathered from Warwick to Lancaster
to haul stone for the building, fifteen
men and eight wagons in two days
bringing in 94 large loads of the finest
stone.</p>
<p>The ministrations of the Church
of England came to the Lancaster
County area very early. The rector
of St. David&rsquo;s Episcopal Church is
known to have made journeys on the
road to Conestoga in 1717 and to have
designed to preach there once a month.</p>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s Church, Pequea, has
had an interesting history since 1728.</p>
<p>Probably the oldest inland Episcopal church in America is the
Bangor Church of Churchtown, founded by the early Welsh in 1722.
The first church built of logs was completed in 1734. This church
derived its name from the Bangor Cathedral in Wales. In its burial
ground lie soldiers of every war, including the French and Indian. It
is said that George Washington worshipped here in 1758 and later
during his winter at Valley Forge.</p>
<p>St. James&rsquo; is the Pioneer Episcopal church in Lancaster city. The
first entry in the record of St. James&rsquo; Parish is dated October 3, 1744.
Land for the building site was donated by James Hamilton. Thomas
Cookson, Lancaster&rsquo;s first Burgess, raised the money for the building.
The church was built in 1754 on the lot still occupied for that purpose,
and has been an historic landmark in Lancaster for more than two
centuries.</p>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s Episcopal Church, Lancaster, dates from 1853. It was
established by Bishop Bowman and was known as St. John&rsquo;s Free Church,
in which the seats would be free to all who desired to avail themselves
of the privileges of God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The Scotch Irish and the Welsh
came to Lancaster County in the second
decade of the 18th century, and brought
with them the tenets of the Presbyterian
church. The Rev. David Evans
founded the Upper Octorara Church in
1720 and was at Donegal in the same
year. For twenty years the immigration
from Ulster averaged 20,000 a year.
Donegal in Lancaster County became
one of the strong seats of Presbyterianism
in America. The Donegal Church
became a center of patriotic endeavor,
both in the French and Indian War and
in the American Revolution. Its story
is unique in American church history.</p>
<p>The Pequea Presbyterian Church
dates back to the Rev. Adam Boyd who
came from Ireland in 1722 and organized
a group of churches west of the
Octoraro. In 1731 the Pequea Church
secured his services every sixth Sabbath.</p>
<p>The first log Pequea Church stood
near a large white oak tree, which is
still standing and marks the spot where
Geo. Whitefield preached.</p>
<p>The Middle Octoraro Presbyterian
Church was organized by the Rev.
Adam Boyd in 1727. In the lower end of the county the Chestnut Level
Church and the Little Britain Church belong to the early colonial period,
as does the Leacock Church of 1739.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="1001" />
<p class="pcap">FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH</p>

<p>The First Presbyterian Church of Lancaster began in 1763, when
James Hamilton granted Lot No. 19 on East Orange Street, on which
a church building was erected in 1767. Services were held in the old
Court House in Centre Square while the church was being built with
funds secured by a lottery enterprise. This method was frequently
used in the 18th century to build churches or construct roads.</p>
<p>The Presbyterian Church of Strasburg was dedicated on Christmas
Day, 1833; that of Marietta in 1821; of Mt. Joy, 1840; of Christiana,
1859; Memorial Presbyterian Church of Lancaster, 1871.</p>
<p>Methodist ministers first visited Lancaster County in 1781, and a
year later the Lancaster Circuit was formed. Bishop Asbury, who died
in 1816, was well known in Lancaster County. He frequently stayed
in Strasburg at the Inn of John Funck who painted his portrait on a
now famous wooden panel in Washington, D. C. The Methodists erected
a church near Willow Street in 1791, and another at Strasburg in 1807.</p>
<p>Fifty-four clergymen are named as having supplied the local Methodist
churches of Lancaster County up to the year 1802 when the Soudersburg
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
church was erected. Boehm&rsquo;s Church, still standing in Pequea township,
was a pioneer Methodist institution. Henry Boehm had a great deal
to do with the founding of the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Lancaster
in 1807. The church building was erected in 1809 at the corner of
Walnut and Christian streets. In 1840 ground was acquired extending the
church lot to Duke street, where a handsome church structure now stands.</p>

<p>St. Paul&rsquo;s Methodist Church dates from 1849; Broad Street from 1867;
Bethel African Methodist Church from 1821. Many Methodist churches
are found in southern Lancaster County and in the Octoraro Valley, and
in all the Boroughs.</p>
<p>The Church of the United Brethren was the outcome of a meeting held
in the Isaac Long barn near Oregon, Lancaster County, in the middle of
the 18th century, when leaders of four denominations decided to be Brethren.
It was not, however, until 1800 that the new denomination was
separately organized. The oldest United Brethren congregation in Lancaster
County is Ranck&rsquo;s in the New Holland Circuit. The congregation met for
forty years in a private house until a church was built in 1844.</p>
<p>There are many United Brethren churches in rural Lancaster County.
The Otterbein U. B. Church in Lancaster City began in 1902 as a
Mission Sunday School and has grown into one of the most vigorous
churches in the city.</p>
<p>It is impossible in this space to do more than mention some of
the other denominations, some of which are comparatively strong in
Lancaster County. There are the United Evangelical churches, the
Winebrennerians, or Church of God, members who have been active
in the county for more than a century; the German Baptists and the
English Baptists; the Church of Christ; the Swedenborgians and the
Evangelical Association.</p>
<p>The Quakers crossed the Atlantic with Wm. Penn, and soon found
their way into what is now Lancaster County. John Kennerly settled
near Christiana in 1691. The first Friends meeting house was erected
by Sadsbury Quakers in 1725. The Bart meeting house, erected 100
years later, represented the views of the Hicksite Friends. In 1758
the Penn Hill meeting house was built. The Quaker meeting house at
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Bird-in-Hand dates from 1749, the same year in which the Lampeter
meeting house was built.</p>
<p>The Church of Our Father (Unitarian) was a rather late arriver
in Lancaster. It was organized in 1902, and the stone church on West
Chestnut Street was dedicated in 1909. The lecture hall in connection
with the church was named Emerson Hall.</p>
<p>Independent congregations like the First Baptist, Calvary Independent,
Seventh Day Adventists, Church of the Nazarene, Pentecostal
Association, Christian Scientists, and Latter Day Saints have substantial
church buildings in Lancaster. To this group we may add the Monastic
Orders of provincial Ephrata, with their remarkable buildings at the
Cloister. These Seventh Day Baptists, with their Prayer Hall, (The
Saal), built about 1734, are unique in American history and folklore.</p>
<p>The first Roman Catholic Mission in Lancaster was established
in 1741. A log church was built in 1742 on the site of the present
St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent. Father Keenan served St. Mary&rsquo;s Church for
more than half a century. St. Joseph&rsquo;s and St. Anthony&rsquo;s followed
in the 19th century. St. Peter&rsquo;s of Elizabethtown was founded in 1752.
A number of Catholic churches are to be found in the boroughs of the
county, and impressive churches have been erected in the city.</p>
<p>The Jewish faith has been established in Lancaster since 1732. The
first organized congregation of Jews in Pennsylvania met at the home
of Joseph Simon, a Lancaster merchant. Later they met in a building
on the northwest corner of North Queen Street and Centre Square. The
first Temple was built in 1866, and the present structure at Duke and
James Streets was dedicated in 1896.</p>
<p>In the nature of the case, we must forego reference to most of the
individual churches in the Lancaster area, in this brief outline. My
purpose in writing this article has been to impress on the public the
fact that religion since early colonial and provincial days has been a
vital factor in the area of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</p>

American Presbyterianism, forced

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Folk Art of the Pennsylvania Dutch</span></h2>
<p class="center">By JANE AND JACOB ZOOK
<br /><i>Pennsylvania Dutch Craftsmen, Writers and Decorators.</i></p>
<p>Hex Signs and Distelfinks, Tulips and Cut Tomatoes, those marvelous
motifs of Pennsylvania Dutch Folk Art, form a part of our American
cultural background which is second to none as a true folk art. In America
there is no equal to this gay, colorful and bold art form of the early
settlers of southeast Pennsylvania. The reading and learning of the
&ldquo;whys and ways&rdquo; of this unique form of art can give not only the satisfaction
of knowing, but also of doing, as its simplicity of design and
frankness of execution inspires those who are untutored to attempt
to create.</p>
<p>As Pennsylvania Dutchmen and craftsmen may we invite you all to
join us in sharing this heritage of ours which is compounded of &ldquo;fun
and fancy&rdquo; and diligent work. Paint our hex signs and distelfinks on
your barns and kitchen cupboards; work the designs into your needle
point and rugs; and decorate your furniture with hearts and tulips.
Let our folk art inspire you to create useful household objects of clay and
wood and adorn them with a gay splash of color and a whimsical motif.</p>
<p>We like to feel that the spirit of the Folk Artist did not die out
entirely around 1850, as the historians claim, but a tiny spark survives
to inspire present day craftsmen. A friend of ours makes beautiful
pottery inspired by our early sgraffito dishes and utensils; another cross
stitches the &ldquo;birds and deers&rdquo; from old samplers onto present day
placemats; we paint fruit and flowers on chairs and chests; and all of
us are greatly influenced by this marvelous source of design. There&rsquo;s a
Hex Sign Painter around these parts who will do a &ldquo;rain sign&rdquo; for you.
He did one last summer for a Texan&rsquo;s barn. Hoping for rain the Texan
hung the sign and the next day &ldquo;the rains came&rdquo;&mdash;so they tell me. So
why not let our love of color and a little of our superstition take hold
of you, and if you have the patience and diligence of a Pennsylvania
Dutchman, get to work and have fun.</p>
<p>Frances Lichten&rsquo;s wonderful book &ldquo;Folk Art of Rural Pennsylvania&rdquo;
should be read by anyone who is interested in the source, the nature
and the form of this art; and, for the more serious student, John Joseph
Stoudt&rsquo;s beautifully written volume, &ldquo;Pennsylvania Dutch Folk Art,&rdquo;
will help explain the mystical significance of the design motifs.</p>
<p>Folk Art as such no longer exists in our land, as a true folk art is
only found in a homogeneous culture. But a definite trend towards
craftsmanship does exist, and too, a definite stirring of pride in producing
beautiful and useful things with one&rsquo;s own hands.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Old Testament Place Names In Lancaster County</span></h2>
<p class="center">By SAMSON A. SHAIN, D.D.
<br /><i>Rabbi, Shaarai Shomayim</i></p>
<p>The Founding Fathers of communities in Lancaster County, as the
Founding Fathers of our Country at large, cherished the Bible as a
guide in their search for equal rights and justice, and especially freedom
to worship God as they had learned to worship Him in the privacy of their
homes and houses of worship. Giving scriptural names to their home and
church communities, accordingly, served to symbolize for them, the attachment
they felt for the liberty they were helping to proclaim in all the land.</p>
<p>Hence, one place our county pioneers called <i>Goshen</i>, land of plenty to
which God had led them. Another place they called <i>Bethel</i>, House of
God, wherein they could freely pour out their hearts in thanks and praise
and petition. Still another they named <i>Mount Nebo</i>, mountain peak with
an all-embracing view of their new Land of Promise. Another, <i>Elim</i>, place
of rest in the shade of one&rsquo;s tree with none to make man afraid. Still
another, <i>Eden</i>, new garden home of delight planted by them in partnership
with God. Yet another, <i>Ephrata</i>, shrine of freedom paid for by the labors
of pioneer men and women, patriarchs and matriarchs of God&rsquo;s newly
chosen people planted in the New Zion he had appointed for them. In this
same spirit, one, John Patton, gave the name <i>Judea</i> to the hill plantation
straddling West Hempfield and Manor Townships on the banks of the
Susquehanna, between Columbia Borough on the north and Washington
Borough on the south, and warranted to him in 1774.</p>
<p>Lancaster County settlers, thus, chose Biblical names for their communities
in the spirit of the Pilgrim Fathers before them, as a way of expressing
thanks to God for leading them safely to these shores of freedom;
as a way of affirming faith that unless God built a house of liberty, they
labor in vain that build it, and as a way of making a promise to labor
mightily to preserve that freedom and bequeath it unsullied to their descendants.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Farmers&rsquo; Markets</span></h2>
<p class="center">By GERALD S. LESTZ
<br /><i>Lancaster New Era staff writer and columnist; publisher of Baer&rsquo;s Agricultural Almanac.</i></p>
<p>Farmers&rsquo; Markets in historic Lancaster date back to the very beginning
of the community, 1730, and are a delight to today&rsquo;s visitors, many
of whom make a special point of &ldquo;going to market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lancaster City owns and operates two farmers&rsquo; markets&mdash;the Central,
just off Penn Square, and the Southern, one block away at S. Queen and
W. Vine Sts.</p>
<p>The Central is located on land deeded by Andrew and Ann Hamilton,
original proprietors, to local officials on May 15, 1730, for use as a
market &ldquo;forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the early days, farmers brought their produce to this location
and sold them in the open. This was a carryover from the European
custom, and no cover was provided until 1757. The present building
was erected in 1889.</p>
<p>The Southern market-house
was built as a
private venture in 1888,
and was continued in that
manner until 1950, when
the property was bought
by the city.</p>
<p>Stands in the markets
are leased on a
yearly basis. Most are
held by the same families
year after year, and many
have been occupied by
several generations.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="648" />
<p class="pcap">SOUTHERN MARKET</p>
</div>
<p>Markets open early, and it is advisable to get to them before midmorning
if you wish to avoid a crush. Local housewives, and men of
the family, regularly come to market armed with sturdy wicker baskets
which are quickly filled as they visit their favorite farmers, produce
dealers, butchers, bakers and vendors of other foodstuffs.</p>
<p>Cut flowers, potted plants, and farm wives&rsquo; handiwork add their own
touches of color.</p>
<p>A visit to market is a memorable experience, in which you encounter
the favorite foods of an area known for hearty appetites and good cooks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="704" />
<p class="pcap">CENTRAL MARKET</p>
</div>
<p>The farmers who maintain stands at the markets travel in from
the countryside surrounding Lancaster early in the day. They park
their cars outside the buildings, and carry in all their offerings to start
each market day afresh.</p>
<p>In days gone by, when horses and wagons were the main means for
travel, the farmers would drive to town the night before and put up at
a downtown inn, stabling their horses in buildings connected with the
hotels. But by 4 A.M. the farmers were up for the day, preparing their
stands for customers.</p>
<p>Modern-day descendants of these earlier generations of farmers
carry on the tradition of early rising. You can be sure that when you
talk to a farmer at 8 A.M., his cows have been milked, eggs have been
gathered, and many other farm chores completed before he drove to
town with his fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Out-of-town visitors are often disappointed when they come to
Lancaster and find that no market is being held that day. Market
days for the Central and Southern follow:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Central is open on Tuesdays and Fridays. 6 A.M. to 5 P.M.</p>
<p class="t2">Best visiting hours: 6 A.M. to 2 P.M.</p>
<p class="t0">Southern is open Saturdays, 5:30 A.M. to 3 P.M.</p>
<p class="t2">Best visiting hours: 6 A.M. to 12 Noon.</p>
</div>
<p>Shopping bags to carry home your purchases are available at the
markets. If you plan to become a &ldquo;regular,&rdquo; however, we suggest you
buy a stout basket.</p>

<p class="center">By HOWARD E. ROHLIN, B.A., M.A.
<br /><i>Field Museum Curator for the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission</i></p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission administers
three properties in the area covered by this guide. Each one is, in
its own way, unique. Cornwall Furnace is a fascinating relic of the
earliest days of American industry. The Pennsylvania Farm Museum
of Landis Valley recalls the days when horses provided transportation,
coal oil provided light and the majority of our citizens lived and worked
on farms. The Ephrata Cloister is a monument to the freedom of conscience
which since the days of William Penn has been a precious part
of the laws of the Commonwealth. The three present a lively and
varying picture of the colorful past in old Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Cornwall Furnace is a monument to the great colonial iron industry
which flourished in the Furnace Hills of Lebanon and Lancaster Counties.
In the region ore was abundant and so was the timber necessary for the
charcoal so voraciously consumed by the old blast methods. Cornwall
and the area surrounding constituted one of the most important munition
centers of the Revolutionary era.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="677" />
<p class="pcap">CORNWALL FURNACE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The Cornwall Ore Banks was the largest open pit iron mining operation
in the United States, until the opening of the Mesabi. During its
active operation more than twenty million tons of ore were removed.
Begun in 1739 by Peter Grubb, the Furnace now stands essentially as
it was after renovations of 1845-56, when the water-powered force draft
system was replaced by steam. The early machinery is still in place
and the plans for restoration include its reactivation.</p>
<p>The village of Cornwall is one of the finest examples of a &ldquo;company
town&rdquo; in the state; laid out, built and maintained by the corporations
which have operated the furnace and mine. The furnace, mine and
village are an outstanding memorial to the better side of the paternalistic
system so common in nineteenth century industry.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Farm Museum of Landis Valley could well be
called the Commonwealth&rsquo;s attic. Begun as a private collection by the
brothers George and Henry Landis it has now become one of the country&rsquo;s
richest and most varied collections of materials dealing with rural
Americana. If you have ever wondered what happened to this or that
gadget that you vaguely remember on grandfather&rsquo;s farm; stop wondering.
It is probably at the Farm Museum.</p>
<p>The Museum has everything from dead fall mouse traps to steam
powered tractors. Its collection of early Pennsylvania farm implements
and craft tools is outstanding. Its collection of early pistols, rifles and
guns is excellent. In its country store and in the restored Landis House
the feeling of the gay nineties and the turn of the century Pennsylvania
have been recaptured.</p>

<p class="pcap">PENNSYLVANIA FARM MUSEUM OF LANDIS VALLEY</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The annual Craft Days at the Museum have proven immensely
popular. During this two-day event all of the ancient crafts represented
in the museum collections flourish again&mdash;hand weaving, spinning, potting,
furniture and tin painting, candle-making, printing, quilting, braiding,
etc. All are demonstrated in appropriate settings. The Conestoga Wagon
is again hitched up and steam tractors, charged up, haul wagon-loads
of children through the nearby fields.</p>
<p>So extensive are the collections that some part of the display is sure
to be of great interest to the visitor.</p>
<p>Today the museum includes many types of structure typical of small
rural Pennsylvania communities of the past ... residential and commercial
buildings which provide an authentic background for the demonstration
of rural arts, crafts and cottage industries.</p>
<p>Ephrata Cloister is the oldest of the properties in this area administered
by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.
Erected between the years 1730 and 1750 it is a unique monument to a
holy experiment that failed.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p10a.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="623" />
<p class="pcap">This outstanding choral group was founded in February, 1959, for the express purpose
of performing the music of the Cloister, as recreated by the Director and Founder of the
Chorus, Mr. Russell P. Getz. During the summer season, a series of public recitals are
given on the Cloister grounds. For information regarding dates, contact The Cloisters,
Ephrata, Pennsylvania.</p>
</div>
<p>Here on the banks of the Cocalico, under the leadership of Conrad
Beissel, a protestant monastic community was established and for a
time flourished. In buildings of a medieval style, reminiscent of their
German homeland, the Seventh Day Baptists worked and lived and
sought to withdraw themselves from a sinful world. The Saron or Sister
House recalls the harsh and primitive conditions under which the nuns
of the order lived. The almonry was the center from which the hospitality
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
of the order was extended to all travelers. The printing press of the order,
one of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s oldest, was used in the preparation of the great
Mennonite work, the <i>Martyr&rsquo;s Mirror</i>, the preparation of which was the
biggest printing job done in colonial America.</p>
<p>Short lived as the community was, it was in its day famed throughout
Europe and America. It was too much the personal creation of
Beissel to long outlast his death and under his successor, Peter Miller,
a period of slow and mellow decline began. The community made its
contribution to the American Revolution in caring for the wounded
brought to Ephrata from the battlefield at Brandywine; many of the
Brothers of Zion joined the dying as victims of the camp fever brought
to the Cloister by their patients. The community was forced to burn
its great buildings on Zion Hill in order to wipe out the infection.</p>
<p>Since 1941 when the Commonwealth acquired the property a very
complete and meticulous restoration has been in progress. The attempt
to duplicate in our day the workmanship of the eighteenth century and
to capture the other-worldly spirit of the original builders has been a
difficult task, but any visitor to the Cloister will be convinced that the
result has justified the efforts.</p>
<p>Two additional properties in Lancaster County are being developed
and will be administered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum
Commission:</p>
<p>The Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania at Strasburg is now under
construction on property adjacent to and joining the Strasburg Rail Road.</p>
<p>Robert Fulton birthplace near Wakefield, in Little Britain Township.
This is an authentic restoration of the original farmhouse where Robert
Fulton was born November 14, 1765.</p>
<p>The Susquehannock State Park, administered by the Dept. of Forests
and Waters, is located on a high observation site on the mighty Susquehanna
River. Opened in 1965 primarily for picnickers, sightseers and
nature lovers, it affords a magnificent view both up and down the river.
The Park is near the huge Muddy Run Hydro Storage Electric Generating
Plant. In addition, several atomic power plants have been built or are
being built on the banks of the Susquehanna River in this area.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">Foods&mdash;And How We Like Them</span></h2>
<p class="center">By EDNA EBY HELLER
<br /><i>Pennsylvania Dutch food columnist and lecturer.</i></p>
<p>Lancaster County cookery definitely reflects the way of life of
the Pennsylvania Dutch. They are a people who are hard working,
creative and thrifty. A great many dishes common in today&rsquo;s Dutch
Cookery were created when a housewife felt compelled to utilize rather
than discard. She wastes nothing in the garden, neither in the kitchen.
That favorite little Milk Pie, she makes from left over pastry!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Pennsylvania Dutch cooking is simple. There
are few salads, but quantities of cookies, cakes and pies. With only a
few exceptions, salads are limited to greens, served with a sweet sour
sauce. Although not many daughters bake bread today, the grandmothers
still set their dough to rise twice weekly. With her bread she will
probably bake Cinnamon Sticky Buns or Moravian Sugar Cake. The
latter is one of the yeast bread delicacies that is slightly fancy and
extremely rich. Butter is the extravagance of Lancaster County cooks,
and they themselves recognize this. One woman told her daughter-in-law:
&ldquo;You better close your eyes while I add the butter to the vegetables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may have heard of the Sweets and Sours of the Pennsylvania
Dutch. These include the spiced fruits, pickled vegetables, jellies and
preserves. Because the Dutchman craves sours with every meal, the
women-folk not only can many pickles, but pickle eggs, red beets,
bologna and other meats. Dutch farmers make great quantities of cider
vinegar for their own use and would not want to have to do without it.</p>
<p>Molasses, too, is indispensable. Twenty-five years ago each grocer
had a molasses barrel or two, but there are only a few left. Barrel
molasses is the table molasses that is spread on butter bread, fried mush,
scrapple, egg cheese, fritters, doughnuts and many other deep-fat-fried
foods. For cookies, cakes and pies, baking molasses is used. In the pie
category alone there are many uses. We use molasses for Shoo-fly Pies,
Molasses Crumb Pies, Molasses Custards, Funny Cake Pies, Montgomery,
McKinley, Quakertown, Union, Lemon Strip Pies, Shellbark Custards
and Vanilla Pies. Yes, we like our molasses! Perhaps, for this craving,
we are indebted to our great-grandmothers who religiously gave their
children molasses and sulphur for a &ldquo;necessary spring tonic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might be noted that we like boiled dinners. Vegetables are frequently
cooked in the same kettle with the meat and potatoes. The
favorite combinations are: cabbage and beef, sauerkraut and pork, green
beans and ham, turnips and beef. More unusual, though, and favorites
of any season, are our Boiled Pot Pies. Squares of dough are dropped
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
into boiling broth to cook with either chicken, veal, pork, or beef. And
again, potatoes are in the same kettle. Some cooks choose to use both
Sweet potatoes and Irish potatoes in the same Pot Pie. You will find
baked meat pies, but they are outnumbered by boiled ones of which the
Chicken Pot Pie is the most popular.</p>
<p>There is a chicken specialty in Lancaster County that attracts great
crowds. Every August and September when the Ladies of the Fire
Company Auxiliaries serve Chicken Corn Soup suppers they make gallons
and gallons. Plenty of chicken and plenty of corn in a rich chicken
broth is tops on our list of soups.</p>
<p>Have you heard about our Funeral Pie? It is none other than a
Raisin Pie. It may be Raisin Crumb or a two-crust Raisin Pie; either
is called Funeral Pie. For as many years as our grandmothers can
remember, this pie was made for the meal that was served to relatives
and friends who had gathered for a funeral. Today, in this age of travel,
there are few of these suppers served excepting among the Amish who
still travel by horse and buggy.</p>
<p>The Shoo-Fly Pie is a common subject of inquiries. Everyone wants
to know the translation of its name, but there is none. The discussion
of whether the name actually came from an occasion when flies were
chased from this molasses pie or whether its rough textured topping gave
it a name similar to the French <i>choufleur</i> meaning cauliflower, has not
yet been reconciled. There are many varieties of Shoo-Fly Pies. The
Dutchman who likes to dunk wants his &ldquo;dry as punk&rdquo; and others like
them &ldquo;gooey as can be.&rdquo; The latter is often referred to as the &ldquo;wet-bottom
shoo-fly.&rdquo; Basically, this pie is made in an unbaked crust that
is partially filled with a molasses mixture and covered with a thick
topping of crumbs, which may or may not be spicy.</p>
<p>On the menu of the restaurant that serves Pennsylvania Dutch
meals you are quite likely to see &ldquo;Schnitz un Knepp.&rdquo; Literally this
means apples and dumplings. Specifically, &ldquo;schnitz&rdquo; are dried apple
slices that are cooked with the dumplings in ham broth and then served
with ham. Dried apple slices can be purchased in many stores, but on
the farm each cook dries her own, just as she dries her own corn and
beans, in the oven, on top of the coal stove or in the sun. Schnitz are
also put into pies or served alone as stewed fruit.</p>
<p>Probably more apples go into Apple Butter which in the Pennsylvania
Dutch dialect is called Lottwaerick. Hand in hand with Lottwaerick
goes Smiercase, the Dutchman&rsquo;s version of cottage cheese, but
much creamier than the commercial cottage cheese. Wherever Lottwaerick
is served, there will be Smiercase. They were made to go
together, we think. A thick slice of homemade bread when spread with
Lottwaerick and then a layer of Smiercase is a joy to man, woman or
child in the Dutch country.</p>
<p>Lancaster countians enjoy the flavor and color of saffron. This is
the dried stigmata of the crocus-like flowers that bloom from a saffron
bulb. Although it is almost extinct in our own cultivation of herbs,
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
we now purchase the imported saffron and use it in breads, potato or
noodle dishes, and always with chicken. This is one of the items that is
regional within this region. Natives of Lancaster and Lebanon Counties
delight in the flavor of saffron as well as its butter color, but no other
Dutch cooks seem to appreciate it as we do.</p>

<p>Throughout all of the Pennsylvania Dutch territory, there is much
deep-fat frying. On Shrove Tuesday everyone eats doughnuts called
Fasnachts, around which hang many folklore tales. But, apart from
this day, there is much frying of doughs and batters. In Lancaster
County there is a dough that is rolled to one-eighth inch thickness and
cut into strips which are fried in deep fat. They are called Plow-lines,
Streivlin, or Snavely Sticks. A generation ago these were made for the
mid morning &ldquo;nine o&rsquo;clock piece&rdquo; that was carried to the farmer in the
fields. In recent years, however, this indulgence is almost a thing of
the past, and so are the Streivlins. What a shame!</p>
<p>The visitor will notice that our food is abundant and our appetites
are hearty. Traditional cooking that is really an art has been passed
from mother to daughter by word of mouth for generations. Each cook
uses &ldquo;a pinch of this and a handful of that&rdquo;; &ldquo;sugar, to sweeten,&rdquo; &ldquo;butter,
the size of a walnut,&rdquo; and &ldquo;flour, to stiffen.&rdquo; Only recently have many
of these recipes been written and standardized. More must be done,
but there has been some progress made for the preservation of this
&ldquo;wonderful good&rdquo; cookery.</p>

<p class="center">By GERALD L. MOLLOY
<br /><i>Manager, Lancaster Chamber of Commerce</i></p>
<p>Lancaster has long been noted for its unusually stable economy.
The factors which contribute to this stability are numerous but
perhaps can best be summarized by pointing out that in this historic
area one finds a unique balance between agriculture, commerce and
industry. Lancaster County ranks in the first five of the 3,073 Counties
in the United States in the value per acre of its agricultural production;
more than 600 industrial plants provide employment for approximately
55,000 industrial workers; and Lancaster City, strategically located in
the center of this prosperous agricultural-industrial County, serves as
the commercial trade center for more than 318,400 persons. Thus with
commerce, industry and agriculture complementing each other, Lancastrians
traditionally have enjoyed a particularly healthy economic
climate.</p>
<p>Since the days prior to the American Revolution, Lancaster has
been famed for its skilled industrial workers and the wide diversity
of precision products manufactured in its factories. With its workers
largely drawn from fourth and fifth generation Lancaster families of
English and German origin, local industry has established a far-flung
reputation for the uniformly high quality of its labor.</p>
<p>Among the products manufactured in Lancaster plants are such nationally
distributed items as Alcoa screw machine products, Armstrong
floor coverings, Black &amp; Decker tools, R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons printing,
Eshelman feeds, Hamilton watches, Howmet aluminum products, Hubley
toys, Lambert-Hudnut cosmetics, New Holland Farm Machinery, R.C.A.
television and electronic tubes, Raybestos asbestos products, Schick electric
shavers and Trojan power boats.</p>
<p>Side by side with industry in Lancaster County, retail trade and
wholesale distribution has grown and prospered since Colonial times.
There are now 450 wholesale firms and over 3,000 retail outlets serving
this thriving area. Attesting to the stability of the local economy is the
fact that included among the retail groups are the oldest department store
and oldest tobacco store in America, each of which is still operated by the
same family interests which founded them and each is still situated at its
original location.</p>
<p>The traditional stability and prosperity of Lancaster industrial
and commercial enterprises form a sound economic base upon which to
build a fine community. This becomes apparent as the visitor views
the excellent schools and hospitals, the recreational and cultural facilities,
the beautiful residential areas and other community assets which
are a hallmark of the good living in Lancaster County.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">Covered Wooden Bridges</span></h2>
<p class="center">By J. RICHARD GAINTNER
<br /><i>Local Authority and Lecturer on Covered Wooden Bridges
<br />See Official Pennsylvania Dutch Guide Map for locations of covered bridges.</i></p>
<p>Always picturesque and just rare enough to arouse interest,
the old covered wooden bridges are growing in popular appeal as
their number diminishes. In fact, collecting pictures and lore about
these structures has become a hobby of many persons. In Lancaster
County there still remain a sufficient number that will whet the appetite
of the most avid hobbyist.</p>
<p>These romantic old spans are dwindling in number as a result of
age, disaster or demolition because of safety or highway improvements,
but it is gratifying to know that of the 108 covered wooden structures
that at one time crossed the creeks and streams of this county, there
are less than 25 still standing.</p>
<p>That so many ancient spans have weathered the years is proof of
the value of the barn-like roof. Care was expended in construction, too,
and a sign was placed at the entrance to &ldquo;Walk Your Horse&rdquo; in order
to avoid excessive vibration which might be harmful to the bridges.
Today the sign reads &ldquo;Warning, this bridge unsafe for loads greater
than 5 Tons.&rdquo; Even though they withstand time and weather, flood and
storm, they are highly vulnerable to fire.</p>
<p>Covered bridges are sometimes erroneously thought to date from
the Colonial and Revolutionary War periods. Actually, many of the
founding fathers, including George Washington, never saw a covered
bridge. The first one was built across the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia
in 1805. Nine years afterward, in 1814, a covered bridge was built
across the Susquehanna at Columbia and Wrightsville which was then
and still remains &ldquo;The longest covered wooden bridge in the world,&rdquo; with
a length of 5,620 feet. This bridge was destroyed by ice in 1832. A
second structure, built in 1834, was burned in 1863, during the war between
the States to prevent the Confederate cavalry from crossing the
river. A third covered wooden span was erected at this site in 1868 and
was destroyed by a violent windstorm in 1896.</p>

<p>Most of the covered structures are maintained by Lancaster County,
four jointly with nearby counties, and here are found some of the most
picturesque and unique settings of all. They are well preserved, painted
and repaired regularly, and with continued care will last another hundred
years. You&rsquo;ll find them on the back roads, off the main thoroughfares,
back where the dirt roads twist and turn around a barn or a wood, you&rsquo;ll
go down a hill over a half dozen &ldquo;thank-you-moms&rdquo; and there tucked
away in some of Lancaster&rsquo;s most harmonious settings you&rsquo;ll find the
most romantic covered wooden bridges you&rsquo;ve ever seen. And maybe,
if you tarry a while you&rsquo;ll see a couple of fishermen, because that&rsquo;s where
the biggest trout are found, or maybe it&rsquo;s a favorite swimming hole for
the neighborhood youngsters.</p>
<p>The shortest covered bridge in Lancaster County is just west of Long
Park, near Oreville. It measures 53 feet long. The longest covered span in
Lancaster County was destroyed by fire in 1970. This bridge, known as
&ldquo;Second Lock Bridge,&rdquo; was 349 feet long and crossed the Conestoga just
off New Danville Pike, south of Conestoga Memorial Cemetery. The last
covered bridge to be built was in 1891 over the Cocalico one-half mile
north of Akron.</p>
<p>It is hoped this bit of Americana, of which Lancaster County has been
blessed with the second largest number in Pennsylvania&mdash;those romantic
symbols of an earlier day&mdash;may be preserved for posterity as historical
monuments.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">The Plain People</span></h2>
<p class="center">By PROFESSOR A. FRED RENTZ
<br /><i>The late Professor Rentz was an Educator and Authority on the Pennsylvania Dutch.</i></p>
<p>Religion was one of the strong motives in the lives of our Pennsylvania
Dutch forbears. It was upon the invitation of William
Penn, who offered them a religious haven in Penn&rsquo;s woods, that they
came to America out of the Palatinate in Germany. The first ones to
come were the Lutherans and Reformed, who even today form the
largest segment of the Pennsylvania Dutch people. The Lutherans and
Reformed were followed in quick succession by the so-called plain people,
the Mennonites, the Amish and the <a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>Brethren; the heart of whose life
is still in Lancaster County, Pa. We speak of them as &ldquo;plain&rdquo; because
they dress in a religious garb. They speak of us as &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; or &ldquo;gay.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Plain and Fancy.&rdquo; Here they live having preserved the customs of our
forefathers most faithfully over a period of two hundred and fifty years.</p>
<p>Of the three plain sects the Mennonites are the oldest historically
and the most numerous. They stem from one Menno Simons, a Catholic
parish priest, who seceded from the church of his fathers in 1536. He
was one of that large group of Anabaptists who could not in good
conscience join the Lutheran and Reformed movements because they
believed in infant baptism. Menno Simons believed only in the baptism
of the believer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t baptize a baby that does not know what it&rsquo;s
doing, but baptize only one who believes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mennonite woman will wear a trim little black bonnet (some are
blue, brown, green) with no skirt on it. Her prayer cap is perched
jauntily on the back of her head. The material in the cap is net, much
finer than the Amish cap. The cap may have strings or not, dependent
on the individual&rsquo;s choice. Her dress may be a solid color, but usually
it will be a print. Her cape is square and is fastened to the belt in
front. Among our Mennonite friends, the apron has disappeared; except
among the more conservative groups.</p>
<p>The Mennonite men usually wear black hats, not broad brimmed.
They are, as a rule, smooth shaven. Their coats are Cadet type, no
collars or lapels; buttoned up to the neck. Their trousers are styled like
those of the gay people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>In 1693 in the Canton of Berne in Switzerland lived Jacob Amman,
in all probability a Mennonite bishop, surely a Mennonite clergyman.
He seceded from the Mennonites on the question of church discipline.
Said he, you Mennonites have lost the way of life of Menno Simons.
You are far too easy on your people. If you excommunicate a brother
or sister for transgressing the laws of God or violating the rules of the
church, all that it means is that they can&rsquo;t partake of the Holy Communion.
It ought to mean far more than that. It ought to mean
&ldquo;meidung&rdquo;&mdash;a German word meaning avoidance, shunning, ostracism.
If we excommunicate some one, we will have no fellowship whatever
with him. If we pass him on the street, we will ignore him. We will
not buy from him, nor will we sell to him. If he&rsquo;s a member of our
family we will not eat at the same table with him. The Old Order
House Amish carry on that tradition to this very day.</p>
<p>Let us first describe the dress of our Amish friends. The Amish
man in the winter time will wear a broad-brimmed, low crowned, felt
hat. In the summer time, natural rye straw. He will wear a beard
after marriage, but no moustache. The moustache in former generations
was the hall-mark of a soldier and, of course, he is adverse to anything
that savors of the Military. His dress jacket will be fastened with hooks
and eyes rather than buttons. The button is too characteristic of the
Military uniform. The front of his dress coat (mootza) is usually cut
in a V at the top and has the old fashioned Prince Albert coat tails.
There are no collar or lapels on his coat. His trousers are broadfalls,
buttoned on the hips like a sailor&rsquo;s trousers.</p>
<p>The Amish woman&rsquo;s garb is likewise interesting. Her headdress
consists of a bonnet and a white cap. The bonnet in the case of adult
women is black. Children often wear blue, purple, green bonnets. It is
rather big, covers virtually all of her hair. &ldquo;The hair is woman&rsquo;s crowning
glory&rdquo; and to expose it, would be vain. There is a long skirt on the
bonnet, extending down to the shoulders, over the nape of the neck.
Underneath the bonnet, the Amish woman will wear a white cap, which
she knows as her prayer cap. This she wears at all times. The cap has
white strings which she ties in a neat bow when she is dressed up. When
she is working the strings will probably float down her back. The prayer
cap has good Scriptural authority, provided we are literalists in interpretation.
St. Paul tells us that we are to &ldquo;pray without ceasing&rdquo; and that
women are not to pray with head uncovered.</p>
<p>Her dress is always a solid color&mdash;blue, purple, violet, green, lavender,
red&mdash;indeed any solid color. Over her shoulders she wears a cape, which
comes to a point at the waist, front and back. The cape may be black
or the same color as the dress. The young women may wear a white cape
when they go to church. A black apron completes her garb. In the case
of the young woman the apron is white when she attends morning worship.</p>
<p>They do have virtues that the rest of us would do well to emulate,
to our own profit and the profit of society in general. For example,
in the Amish community the writer knows an Amish blacksmith, one
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
of the most God-like gentlemen that it has been his privilege to know.
The blacksmith does more work, takes in more money on a Saturday
than any other day of the week. Some years ago, his neighbor, a
&ldquo;gay&rdquo; farmer, was ill. It was Saturday morning. The farmer&rsquo;s hay
was lying in the field, ready to be taken into the barn. What did the
blacksmith do? He locked up his shop, took himself and his son into
the hayfield and by evening the hay was in the barn of the ill farmer.
The blacksmith sacrificed his best day&rsquo;s wages to help his neighbor
and brother.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="jri">Photo by Jim Hess</span>
<br />AMISH GIRL&rsquo;S BONNET, AMISH WOMAN&rsquo;S BONNET, PRAYER CAP AND DRESS</p>
</div>
<p>Second:&mdash;As we drive through the Amish community and observe
their farms and farm buildings we need to remember that there is no
fire insurance on the buildings. They look upon insurance as an effort
to thwart the will of God. But, let the biggest barn in the Amish
community burn to the ground, in ten days or so after the fire, some
morning a hundred, two hundred, as high as three hundred Amishmen,
will appear; armed with hammers, hatchets, saws&mdash;whatever it takes
to build a barn&mdash;and by evening a new barn will stand on the site.
For the material, they will contribute into a common fund. The women
will serve two dinners, one at noon, one in the evening. The writer
saw a barn raising one day. At four fifteen o&rsquo;clock in the evening the
completed barn stood there. On this barn 201 men were helping. The
writer said to the farmer &ldquo;Uncle Isaac, this must have cost you a
pretty penny, just to feed so many men.&rdquo; Said Uncle Isaac, &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t
cost me a cent, the brethren furnished it all.&rdquo; Mutual helpfulness is
still a virtue.</p>
<p>Third:&mdash;During the economic depression of the thirties not one
penny was paid to an Amish family out of public funds by way of
relief. They took care of themselves.</p>
<p>Fourth:&mdash;When the Roosevelt administration came to power in
1932 and its department of agriculture found too much wheat, too
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
many pigs, they said, &ldquo;Let your land lie fallow. We will pay you a
subsidy.&rdquo; The answer of our Amish farmer was, &ldquo;Nothing doing. This
land is a trust from God. Farm it, we will. If you don&rsquo;t want wheat,
we will not farm wheat, nor will we raise pigs, if they are not needed,
but farm our land we will, and we don&rsquo;t want your subsidy. Self reliance
is still a virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<br />LANCASTER COUNTY BARN RAISING</p>
</div>
<p>The third sect of plain people is the Church of the Brethren or
Dunkards. They stem from Alexander Mack, a Mennonite clergyman
who seceded from the Mennonites in Schwarzenau, Germany in 1708
on his interpretation of baptism. The Mennonite commonly sprinkles
in baptism. Mack taught that to be baptized properly one ought to
be immersed, &ldquo;dunked&rdquo; if you please.</p>
<p>The Church of the Brethren have largely lost their &ldquo;Plain Way&rdquo; of
life. Since they have gone in for higher education, their garb has largely
disappeared. Few of the men wear beards and most of the Brethren
use regular clothing. However, some still wear a garb similar to the
Mennonites, the favorite color of the men being grey.</p>
<p>There is one sect of Dunkards, the Old Order River Brethren,
very plain, just as plain as the Amish. These people are not a
numerically large sect, for there are only approximately 12,000 of them
in America. However, they deserve mention, for it was from them that
President Eisenhower descended, whose grandfather, the Rev. Jacob
Eisenhower, was a minister in the sect.</p>
<p>We, who live in Lancaster County, respect these plain folks most
profoundly. They are our neighbors and we find them good neighbors.
They have made a contribution to our agriculture, greater than their
numbers warrant, to make our county the richest non-irrigated agricultural
county in America.</p>
<p>They are a peace loving people whom you do not find in the courts
either as prosecutors or defendants. All they ask of you and me is to be
let alone to lead their lives in the light as God has given it to them
to see the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">The Pennsylvania Dutch Language</span></h2>
<p class="center">By DR. J. WILLIAM FREY
<br /><i>Chairman of the Department of German and Russian at Franklin and Marshall College</i></p>
<p>We bisht? We gaits? (How are you? How goes it?) That&rsquo;s
the familiar greeting throughout the length and breadth of the
Pennsylvania Dutch country. This is symbolic of the relative sameness
of the Pennsylvania Dutch tongue no matter where you go in southeastern
Pennsylvania or, in fact, anywhere else a Dutchman has happened
to wander. This is linguistically and culturally a unique phenomenon.
Travel in any European country&mdash;staying away from the large cities&mdash;and
you will find almost mutually unintelligible dialects spoken from
one community to the next, a mere dozen or so miles away. These wide
language divergencies reflect vast cultural-historical differences, deep-rooted
in tradition and folkways. But in the Pennsylvania Dutchland&mdash;whether
you visit the Amish on their unparalleled farms of Lancaster
County or whether you call on the Church groups (Lutheran and Reformed)
located almost directly north of Philadelphia&mdash;you will find
Pennsylvania Dutch spoken and understood with only enough differences
to make it interesting. In fact, there is not nearly so much difference in
the pronunciation and vocabulary and idioms of one brand of Pennsylvania
Dutch from another as there is, say, between the native speech
of a Bostonian and that of a Charlestonian!</p>
<p>The uniqueness of the situation is perhaps amazing to a European,
but hardly to an American. Here in the greatest melting pot culture in
the world it is no new thing to find widely diversified groups leveling off
their ways and their speech to form a common American denominator.
In the Pennsylvania Dutch country we have by far the most widely
diversified folk culture in America and at the same time a unity of
language which astounds the scholars of linguistic science. There has
never really been any such thing as a &lsquo;united front&rsquo; among the Pennsylvania
Dutch people&mdash;no nationalistic-political ties, no yearning for some
once-deserted-now-idealized &lsquo;fatherland,&rsquo; no dominant (nor domineering)
religious body. Hence, our language has never taken on any &lsquo;standardizing&rsquo;
regulations, has never been given a hard and fast orthography,
has never been elevated to the position of a subject in the public school
curriculum, has never enjoyed the so-called dignity of great oratory,
classic literature or even journalism.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>It has always been and always will be only FOLK SPEECH. As
such it is the perfect oral expression of our Pennsylvania Dutch folk
and their rich folk culture. But as such it has also suffered greatly&mdash;mocked
and despised and branded as &lsquo;only a dialect,&rsquo; &lsquo;a corrupt form
of German,&rsquo; &lsquo;a kind of Pennsylvania hog Latin&rsquo; by all those in the past
who, not appreciating nor even knowing what folk culture really is and
means, could see no good in a language which according to their puny
and narrow educational background &lsquo;did not even have a grammar or
a dictionary&rsquo;! Only very recently have those of us who are interested
in the study of folk cultures and folk linguistics seen the real and underlying
values in the language&mdash;now, at a time when it is very rapidly
dying out, when hardly any member of the new generation speaks anything
but English (though that with often a heavy Pennsylvania Dutch
savor), when the near future will witness the almost complete disappearance
of this interesting, humorous, beloved folk speech except for its
persistent employment by the Old Order Amish in their religious services
and most of their everyday conversations.</p>
<p>No grammar? EVERY language has grammar&mdash;Pennsylvania Dutch
has its share to be sure. There are ten parts of speech, three genders
of nouns (and you can&rsquo;t hang a feminine article on a masculine noun!).</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Outen the light</i>&rsquo; is our common Lancaster County way of saying
&lsquo;turn out the light,&rsquo; and it is simply a short and efficient expression for
getting the deed accomplished. The same is true of the shortened form
&lsquo;<i>this after</i>&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;this afternoon&rsquo;&mdash;an expression you&rsquo;ll hear from
the lips of every Lancaster City and County inhabitant.</p>
<p>Some expressions in our quaint English here are actually direct
translations from the Pennsylvania Dutch language, but they have become
such common property that many a Lancastrian uses them even
though his background is anything but Dutch. For example, a beautiful
little phrase to indicate that you &lsquo;live next door&rsquo; to someone is the very
warm idiom: &lsquo;<i>they live neighbors to us</i>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<i>we live neighbors to them</i>.&rsquo;
Now isn&rsquo;t that a real friendly way of putting it?</p>
<p>Actually, then, the impress of Pennsylvania Dutch upon the Nation
linguistically has been negligible. It is not enough to boast about the
Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry of the Hoovers, the Earharts, and the
Eisenhowers when the Nation as a whole has not been conscious of the
existence of our deep-rooted folk culture over some nine generations.
Meanwhile, however, we bid farewell to the visitor in the Dutch country
with those familiar words heard in Lancaster County: <i>koom boll widder!</i>
(come soon again)&mdash;or, better, the idiom as it is used in the more eastern
counties: <i>koom ols widder</i> (keep coming, and coming, and coming, and
coming to see us ...).</p>

<p class="center">By PROF. FREDERIC S. KLEIN
<br /><i>Member of the Department of History at Franklin and Marshall College</i></p>
<p>The Lancaster community has inherited a rich tradition of cultural
activity and interest since colonial days, and offers a wide
variety of opportunity for enjoyment, appreciation and participation in
the fields of music, the arts, the theatre, and educational facilities.</p>
<p>Music has a prominent part in the life of Lancaster. The Lancaster
Symphony Orchestra, composed of professional and non-professional
musicians in the community, presents a series of concerts throughout the
season, including classical, popular and youth concerts, and presenting
guest artists of high calibre. Its fine musical standards have given it
recognition as one of the outstanding community orchestras in the State,
and it provides opportunities for young musicians and music students
in the area to develop their musical talents. Another musical group,
the Vivaldi Chamber Orchestra, is composed entirely of girls, and presents
regular concerts sponsored by the Y.W.C.A., with special emphasis
on classical music and the use of rare musical instruments. Many church
and choral groups present formal concerts throughout the year, and a
regular series of concert programs is sponsored by a local committee of
the Community Concert Association, which brings artists and musical
groups to the city.</p>
<p>One of the most recent additions to the musical life of Lancaster
is the unique Amphitheatre in Long Park, about one mile west of the
city on the old Harrisburg Pike. Located in a beautiful natural setting
for open-air concerts, ceremonies or community gatherings, the attractive
structure provides stage accommodations for full-size orchestras and seating
capacity on the lawn for approximately 10,000 persons. It was constructed
through community contributions and civic club interest.</p>
<p>Several theatre groups are active in Lancaster. Foremost among
them is the Green Room Theatre of Franklin and Marshall College,
which presents a regular series of plays of professional quality. Dramatic
productions are also presented regularly by community organizations
such as the Lancaster Theatre Arts Association, the Musicomedy Guild,
and the Opera Workshop. All of these groups offer opportunities to
persons interested in theatrical production, for participation or for training
and experience on the stage. A number of summer theatre programs are
presented in the Lancaster area, such as the Gretna Playhouse and the
Ephrata Legion Star Playhouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>The restoration and preservation of the Fulton Opera House on North
Prince Street has provided the community with a beautiful and historic
theatre in central Lancaster, completely equipped for the presentation of
plays, concerts and special attractions. One of the oldest original theatres
in the country, the Fulton stage has presented almost all of the great personalities
of the theatrical and concert world since it was built in 1852,
and today, its red, white and gold d&eacute;cor and its excellent acoustics have
made it an attractive center of cultural activities.</p>
<p>Artists have found Lancaster County to be an inspiring atmosphere for
expression through paint and canvas. A number of art clubs and associations
provide opportunities for study under professional art teachers, for
sketching and painting groups and for exhibitions. Two such groups are
Lancaster County Art Association and Echo Valley Art Association. The
picturesque qualities of the Lancaster countryside, with its covered bridges,
quaint barns and rural scenery provide unusual subject matter.</p>
<p>The library facilities of the Lancaster community are excellent. The
new building of the Lancaster Free Public Library contains almost 100,000
volumes, and the library provides many services for the community. The
Fackenthal Library of Franklin and Marshall College is available for
public use, with a collection of 172,000 volumes, modern facilities for
periodicals, reference works, a browsing room and many special collections
of Lincoln and Napoleon.</p>
<p>The Fackenthal Library is also the headquarters of the Pennsylvania-German
Society, which is concerned with preserving material pertaining to

<p>The Lancaster County Historical Society, located adjacent to
Wheatland, home of President Buchanan on Marietta Avenue, also
possesses a fine library which is widely used for historical and genealogical
reference work in connection with Lancaster County history.
The Willson Memorial Building, one of the finest historical society
buildings in the state, contains an auditorium, reference-reading rooms,
and an excellent museum where exhibits of unusual documents and
articles associated with Lancaster County history are on display. The
facilities of the Society are open to the public without charge, and the
publications of the Society, containing special articles on many phases
of local history, are available for purchase.</p>
<p>Much of the cultural life of Lancaster has been influenced by its
educational institutions. Franklin and Marshall College, established in
1787, is one of the outstanding liberal arts colleges in the East, and provides
many educational opportunities to the community in addition to
its regular program of studies. Lectures, musical programs, and the
facilities of the North Museum and Planetarium are available for the
public. Other colleges in the area include Millersville State College, one
of the state&rsquo;s finest teacher training institutions; Elizabethtown College;
and the Linden Hall Junior College for Girls.</p>
<p>Lancaster is unusually fortunate in the fact that as it has grown
from a small community into a modern and prosperous Pennsylvania
city, its cultural assets and facilities have kept pace with its rapid
economic and industrial growth, and its citizens have provided the music,
the arts and the educational facilities which have made it a wholesome
and progressive community.</p>

<p>Certainly no one could deny that to millions the world over the name
Hershey is synonymous with chocolate. However, a visit to the unique
town of Hershey will convince you that the name of one of America&rsquo;s great
industrial geniuses stands for many other things&mdash;and not the least of
these is charity.</p>
<p>There is much to see and do in The Chocolate Town. One can enjoy a
guided tour of the Hershey factory, a visit to the Museum, the facilities
of the Amusement Park, a swim in the pool or the animals in The Zoo. He

<p>Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the place where one President spoke and
another resided, represents many things to many people. To some there
is the thrill of identification, as they view the 2300 markers and monuments
on the Battlefield, where men from 25 states reached heights of
bravery that have seldom been equalled.</p>
<p>For many, Gettysburg&rsquo;s fine museums hold great attraction. The
National Museum, with the world&rsquo;s largest collection of Civil War articles,
houses the famed electric map. The Hall of Presidents depicts the history
of the nation &ldquo;as told by the Presidents themselves.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
